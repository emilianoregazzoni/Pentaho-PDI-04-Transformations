# Pentaho-PDI-04-Transformations
Pentaho PDI Trasnformations project is a small project about doing ETL works with Spoon.


First of all I have to understand the script provided by instructor. 
It's about an accouting system with people and vouchers related. The database works with 5 main tables:

It also has the relationships between the tables. The pk and fk are at the end of the script:

After review the script I should go to Postgres admin (PG admin), paste the code and run it. Now I can see the tables I'll be working on

In the repository is all the transformations in Pentaho. 

Here I post some pictures about the final ETL jobs.
